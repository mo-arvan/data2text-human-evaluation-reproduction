The Nets hit the Cavaliers with a big wake - up call , sending them packing with a loss . Brooklyn came out tough from the start and led 59 - 49 at halftime , however Cleveland responded with a big third quarter and took a three - point lead into the fourth . The Nets were relentless as they battled back in the fourth , beginning with 10 points in the first four minutes , including eight from Rondae Hollis-Jefferson . Cleveland still managed to get up by two with six minutes left , but that is when the Nets went on a 14 - to - 3 run to end the game and upset the top team in the East . This result snaps a three - game losing streak for the Nets and a two game winning streak by the Cavs . The clubs have one more meeting before the end of the season , with the season - series at 2 - 1 for Cleveland . Five players scored in double digits for Brooklyn , while all six remaining players to hit the floor also contributed significantly on the scorecard , making this a true team - effort .

The Nets assisted on 28 of their 41 field goals while their defense held the Cavs to only 44 percent from the field , 26 percent from long range and forced Cleveland into 15 turnovers . LeBron James had a very solid outing , with 30 points ( 13 - 16 FG , 1 - 3 3Pt , 3 - 4 FT ) , six rebounds , five assists and one steal , in 35 minutes of action , but it was not enough to get his team over the hump in this one . Only two other players scored in double digits other than LeBron , including Kyrie Irving , who shot 6 - 22 , on his way to 13 points , and Kevin Love , who shot 5 - 14 , for 11 points . The Cavs team , other than LeBron , was not able to get in any kind of offensive groove as they were stifled in Brooklyn . Next , the Cavs will play in New York , against the Knicks on Saturday .

After Milwaukee beat the undefeated Golden State Warriors in their most recent game , fans hoped they came out of their slump . Clearly not , as the Lakers handled them here in a blowout win . The Lakers had a 20 - point lead after three quarters and this game was well out of hand before the final buzzer . The rebounding was the big difference , as the Lakers grabbed 52 to Milwaukee 's 38 . The free - throw shooting was a huge disparity as well , as the Lakers hit 21 - of - 25 while the Bucks went just 11 - for - 20 . Milwaukee was coming off one of their biggest wins in team history , but it does n't matter much anymore after losing to a four - win Lakers team . They still want 1 - 1 in those two games like everyone expected and that win means almost nothing now . This team continues to play poorly on both ends and there does n't seem to be a light at the end of the tunnel . Michael Carter-Williams was the lone bright spot in this game , as he tallied 19 points , five rebounds and five assists off the bench . They did have to play this game without Greg Monroe and that left them with very little post presence . Monroe missed the game due to some knee soreness and his status is up in the air for Milwaukee 's next game against the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday . The Lakers have been struggling mightily all season , but this was a great all - around performance . Seven players scored in double - figures with Kobe Bryant leading the team with 22 points . The bench was espcially good , as youngsters Julius Randle and D'Angelo Russell both played well here . Randle recorded a 14 point - 14 rebound double - double , while Russell amassed 19 points , seven assists and four rebounds . It 's rare to see this Lakers team hit on all cylinders like this , but it 's a good sight for Los Angeles fans .

When it was all said and done , the pair of guards who struggled throughout five periods bested the two with the hot hand . In an overtime thriller in London , DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry played as if they 'd left their shots back across the Atlantic , going a combined 9 - for - 39 from the field . Meanwhile , the Magic duo of Victor Oladipo and Evan Fournier caught fire , particularly in the second half , to drain 18 of their 31 field - goal attempts . However , despite a game - high 27 points , Oladipo could n't find the net when he needed it most , missing a 27 - foot three - point jumper with two seconds left that almost certainly would 've given the Magic a 98 - 96 victory . He then subsequently lost the handle on a drive to the basket with 2 seconds left in overtime as he attempted to tie the game at 105 , essentially sealing Orlando 's fate . Lowry did manage to lead the Raptors with 24 points despite the subpar shooting performance , as he was able to drain 12 of 14 attempts from the charity stripe . He also hauled in eight rebounds , dished out seven assists , and tallied a block and a steal . DeRozan contributed a modest 13 points , but was outstanding on the boards , posting a season - high 11 rebounds for his first double - double of the season . Jonas Valanciunas matched DeRozan 's scoring total and added nine boards , two assists , a steal and three blocks , two of which were key stuffs of Nikola Vucevic in the fourth quarter and overtime , respectively . Luis Scola put together a solid contribution of 11 points , two rebounds and three steals , while three Raptors reserves were highly efficient . Corey Joseph led the way with 19 points , four assists , three rebounds and a pair of steals over a robust 36 minutes , while Bismack Biyombo and Patrick Patterson pitched in with a pair of 11 - point outings . The latter 's scoring partly consisted of a trio of three - pointers , which tied him with Scola for the team lead in that category on the afternoon . The Raptors improved to 25 - 15 and remain atop the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division . They head back home to take on the Brooklyn Nets on Monday .

Tobias Harris nearly matched him point - for - point and board - for - board , tallying 16 on the scoreboard and hauling in 11 off the glass . He also dished out three assists and recorded a steal . Jason Smith was outstanding off the bench in the first half for Orlando with 16 points , but came up empty scoring - wise in the second half and the extra period .

Meanwhile , the Magic duo of Victor Oladipo and Evan Fournier caught fire , particularly in the second half , to drain 18 of their 31 field - goal attempts . However , despite a game - high 27 points , Oladipo could n't find the net when he needed it most , missing a 27 - foot three - point jumper with two seconds left that almost certainly would 've given the Magic a 98 - 96 victory . He then subsequently lost the handle on a drive to the basket with 2 seconds left in overtime as he attempted to tie the game at 105 , essentially sealing Orlando 's fate . Lowry did manage to lead the Raptors with 24 points despite the subpar shooting performance , as he was able to drain 12 of 14 attempts from the charity stripe . He also hauled in eight rebounds , dished out seven assists , and tallied a block and a steal . DeRozan contributed a modest 13 points , but was outstanding on the boards , posting a season - high 11 rebounds for his first double - double of the season . Jonas Valanciunas matched DeRozan 's scoring total and added nine boards , two assists , a steal and three blocks , two of which were key stuffs of Nikola Vucevic in the fourth quarter and overtime , respectively . Luis Scola put together a solid contribution of 11 points , two rebounds and three steals , while three Raptors reserves were highly efficient . Corey Joseph led the way with 19 points , four assists , three rebounds and a pair of steals over a robust 36 minutes , while Bismack Biyombo and Patrick Patterson pitched in with a pair of 11 - point outings . The latter 's scoring partly consisted of a trio of three - pointers , which tied him with Scola for the team lead in that category on the afternoon . The Raptors improved to 25 - 15 and remain atop the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division . They head back home to take on the Brooklyn Nets on Monday . Oladipo 's 27 points were supplemented by six rebounds , six assists and a pair of steals . Fournier was right on his heels with 21 points , three assists , three rebounds and a steal . Nikola Vucevic posted a 17 - point , 11 - rebound double - double , which he complemented with four assists and three blocks . Tobias Harris nearly matched him point - for - point and board - for - board , tallying 16 on the scoreboard and hauling in 11 off the glass . He also dished out three assists and recorded a steal . Jason Smith was outstanding off the bench in the first half for Orlando with 16 points , but came up empty scoring - wise in the second half and the extra period . He did add five rebounds , four assists and a block . The Magic fell to 20 - 19 and remain in third place in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division . They take the long trip back home to face off against the division - leading Atlanta Hawks on Monday .",sys0,"The Orlando Raptors ( 25 - 15 ) defeated the Orlando Magic ( 20 - 19 ) 106 - 103 on Wednesday at the Amway Center in Orlando .
