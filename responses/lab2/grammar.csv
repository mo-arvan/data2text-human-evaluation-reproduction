McCollum , who has provided the perfect complement at the two - guard spot . McCollum finished with 18 points , six rebounds , and four assists in 36 minutes . Rookie Karl-Anthony Towns has started off his NBA career on the right foot , but took a small step back against Portland on Monday . He had a quiet night offensively , scoring just 11 points on 5 - of - 9 shooting from the field and pulled down only five rebounds in 27 minutes . Towns was in foul trouble all night , but did however manage to block four shots and did an excellent job keeping the Blazers frontcourt in check . Ricky Rubio came just short of a triple - double with 12 points , nine assists , and nine rebounds in 32 minutes , while Andrew Wiggins had another off night shooting the basketball with 16 points on 5 - of - 17 from the field .

After Milwaukee beat the undefeated Golden State Warriors in their most recent game , fans hoped they came out of their slump . Clearly not , as the Lakers handled them here in a blowout win . The Lakers had a 20 - point lead after three quarters and this game was well out of hand before the final buzzer . The rebounding was the big difference , as the Lakers grabbed 52 to Milwaukee 's 38 . The free - throw shooting was a huge disparity as well , as the Lakers hit 21 - of - 25 while the Bucks went just 11 - for - 20 . Milwaukee was coming off one of their biggest wins in team history , but it does n't matter much anymore after losing to a four - win Lakers team . They still want 1 - 1 in those two games like everyone expected and that win means almost nothing now . This team continues to play poorly on both ends and there does n't seem to be a light at the end of the tunnel . Michael Carter-Williams was the lone bright spot in this game , as he tallied 19 points , five rebounds and five assists off the bench . They did have to play this game without Greg Monroe and that left them with very little post presence . Monroe missed the game due to some knee soreness and his status is up in the air for Milwaukee 's next game against the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday . The Lakers have been struggling mightily all season , but this was a great all - around performance . Seven players scored in double - figures with Kobe Bryant leading the team with 22 points . The bench was espcially good , as youngsters Julius Randle and D'Angelo Russell both played well here . Randle recorded a 14 point - 14 rebound double - double , while Russell amassed 19 points , seven assists and four rebounds . It 's rare to see this Lakers team hit on all cylinders like this , but it 's a good sight for Los Angeles fans . They 'll look to build off this rare win , when they take in the Houston Rockets on Thursday in their next scheduled game .",sys0,B,"{""user_agent"":""Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/114.0"",""clicks"":[{""click_x"":679,""click_y"":552,""nodeName"":""INPUT"",""id_tag"":""next-intro"",""time"":""Fri Jun 30 2023 11:12:54 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)""},{""click_x"":446,""click_y"":549,""nodeName"":""INPUT"",""id_tag"":""next-intro"",""time"":""Fri Jun 30 2023 11:13:08 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)""},{""click_x"":125,""click_y"":726,""nodeName"":""INPUT"",""id_tag"":""best_grammar"",""time"":""Fri Jun 30 2023 11:13:29 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)""},{""click_x"":305,""click_y"":722,""nodeName"":""INPUT"",""id_tag"":""worst_grammar"",""time"":""Fri Jun 30 2023 11:13:33 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)""},{""click_x"":109,""click_y"":506,""nodeName"":""INPUT"",""id_tag"":""next-summary1"",""time"":""Fri Jun 30 2023 11:13:49 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)""},{""click_x"":637,""click_y"":250,""nodeName"":""TEXTAREA"",""id_tag"":""feedback"",""time"":""Fri Jun 30 2023 11:13:51 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)""},{""click_x"":720,""click_y"":392,""nodeName"":""INPUT"",""id_tag"":""submitButton"",""time"":""Fri Jun 30 2023 11:13:55 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)""}],""start_time"":""Fri Jun 30 2023 10:41:31 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)""}",,good,A,,

The Pacers ' next game will be on the road against the Toronto Raptors on Wednesday , while the Pacers will be at home against the Brooklyn Nets on Friday . For the Lakers , it was a disappointing loss for the Lakers . Lou Williams was the only player to score in double figures , as he finished with 19 points ( 7 - 14 FG , 3 - 8 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) and five assists . Rookie Jordan Clarkson also had a strong showing off the bench . He went 7 - for - 16 from the field and 0 - for - 4 from the three - point line to score 15 points in 31 minutes .",sys4,"Considering how close this game was , it was strange how the lead was split . In fact , the Lakers led for less than four minutes of this game and the two teams were within six points for nearly the entirety of the fourth quarter . The Lakers bench was the only thing keeping it close , as they outscored the starters 64 - 44 . Six bench players played at least 14 minutes for Los Angeles , with no starter playing more than 21 minutes . The five Indiana starters actually outscored the Los Angeles starters 79 - 44 . Despite playing just 20 minutes in this game due to foul trouble , Juluis Randle fell one point shy of a double - double with his nine points and 10 rebounds . Thaddeus Young was the only starter in this game to shoot above 50 percent from the field , as he went 6 - for - 8 in a 14 - point , six - rebound performance .",sys0,B,"{""user_agent"":""Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/114.0.0.0 Safari/537.36"",""clicks"":[{""click_x"":681,""click_y"":1371,""nodeName"":""INPUT"",""id_tag"":""next-intro"",""time"":""Thu Jun 29 2023 10:39:28 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)""},{""click_x"":424,""click_y"":2617,""nodeName"":""INPUT"",""id_tag"":""next-intro"",""time"":""Thu Jun 29 2023 10:39:33 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)""},{""click_x"":129,""click_y"":567,""nodeName"":""INPUT"",""id_tag"":""best_grammar"",""time"":""Thu Jun 29 2023 10:39:35 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)""},{""click_x"":280,""click_y"":571,""nodeName"":""INPUT"",""id_tag"":""worst_grammar"",""time"":""Thu Jun 29 2023 10:39:37 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)""},{""click_x"":79,""click_y"":649,""nodeName"":""INPUT"",""id_tag"":""next-summary1"",""time"":""Thu Jun 29 2023 10:39:49 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)""},{""click_x"":1119,""click_y"":114,""nodeName"":""INPUT"",""id_tag"":""englishY"",""time"":""Thu Jun 29 2023 10:40:05 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)""},{""click_x"":1020,""click_y"":400,""nodeName"":""INPUT"",""id_tag"":""submitButton"",""time"":""Thu Jun 29 2023 10:40:08 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)""}],""start_time"":""Thu Jun 29 2023 10:28:47 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)""}",1.0,{},A,,

The Nets hit the Cavaliers with a big wake - up call , sending them packing with a loss . Brooklyn came out tough from the start and led 59 - 49 at halftime , however Cleveland responded with a big third quarter and took a three - point lead into the fourth . The Nets were relentless as they battled back in the fourth , beginning with 10 points in the first four minutes , including eight from Rondae Hollis-Jefferson . Cleveland still managed to get up by two with six minutes left , but that is when the Nets went on a 14 - to - 3 run to end the game and upset the top team in the East . This result snaps a three - game losing streak for the Nets and a two game winning streak by the Cavs . The clubs have one more meeting before the end of the season , with the season - series at 2 - 1 for Cleveland . Five players scored in double digits for Brooklyn , while all six remaining players to hit the floor also contributed significantly on the scorecard , making this a true team - effort . Brook Lopez led the way with 22 points , seven rebounds and five assists , in 31 minutes , while Shane Larkin also came up large , with 16 points , seven assists and three rebounds , in 31 minutes . The Nets assisted on 28 of their 41 field goals while their defense held the Cavs to only 44 percent from the field , 26 percent from long range and forced Cleveland into 15 turnovers . LeBron James had a very solid outing , with 30 points ( 13 - 16 FG , 1 - 3 3Pt , 3 - 4 FT ) , six rebounds , five assists and one steal , in 35 minutes of action , but it was not enough to get his team over the hump in this one . Only two other players scored in double digits other than LeBron , including Kyrie Irving , who shot 6 - 22 , on his way to 13 points , and Kevin Love , who shot 5 - 14 , for 11 points . The Cavs team , other than LeBron , was not able to get in any kind of offensive groove as they were stifled in Brooklyn . Next , the Cavs will play in New York , against the Knicks on Saturday .
