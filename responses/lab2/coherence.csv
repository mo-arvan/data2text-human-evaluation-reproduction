In an overtime thriller in London , DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry played as if they 'd left their shots back across the Atlantic , going a combined 9 - for - 39 from the field . Meanwhile , the Magic duo of Victor Oladipo and Evan Fournier caught fire , particularly in the second half , to drain 18 of their 31 field - goal attempts . However , despite a game - high 27 points , Oladipo could n't find the net when he needed it most , missing a 27 - foot three - point jumper with two seconds left that almost certainly would 've given the Magic a 98 - 96 victory . He then subsequently lost the handle on a drive to the basket with 2 seconds left in overtime as he attempted to tie the game at 105 , essentially sealing Orlando 's fate . Lowry did manage to lead the Raptors with 24 points despite the subpar shooting performance , as he was able to drain 12 of 14 attempts from the charity stripe . He also hauled in eight rebounds , dished out seven assists , and tallied a block and a steal . DeRozan contributed a modest 13 points , but was outstanding on the boards , posting a season - high 11 rebounds for his first double - double of the season . Jonas Valanciunas matched DeRozan 's scoring total and added nine boards , two assists , a steal and three blocks , two of which were key stuffs of Nikola Vucevic in the fourth quarter and overtime , respectively . Luis Scola put together a solid contribution of 11 points , two rebounds and three steals , while three Raptors reserves were highly efficient . Corey Joseph led the way with 19 points , four assists , three rebounds and a pair of steals over a robust 36 minutes , while Bismack Biyombo and Patrick Patterson pitched in with a pair of 11 - point outings . The latter 's scoring partly consisted of a trio of three - pointers , which tied him with Scola for the team lead in that category on the afternoon .

Throughout a difficult start to the season that has included multi - game injuries to starters Chris Paul and J. J.

Sunday , even Griffin succumbed to the malaise that currently seems to surround Los Angeles , mustering a season - low nine points , along with six rebounds , four assists and a pair of steals . He also turned the ball over a season - high six times in a forgettable performance versus a Raptors defense that had been vulernable to opposing power forwards coming into the game . Toronto enjoyed impressive contributions from every starter , with DeMarre Carroll and DeMar DeRozan leading the way with a pair of 21 - point efforts . Kyle Lowry pitched in with his second double - double of the season ( 13 points , 10 assists ) , while veteran power forward Luis Scola continued a resurgent age - 35 season with 20 points and eight rebounds . It was the second outing with 20 or more points for Scola in his last three contests . Meanwhile , Bismack Biyombo posted six points and a season - best 14 rebounds in a season - high 31 minutes of playing time . Toronto improved to 9 - 6 and remains in first place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division . They head home for a date with the Cavaliers on Wednesday . The Clippers received rather pedestrian offensive efforts from other starters besides Griffin as well . Redick managed a team - high 17 points in his second game back from a back injury , while Paul and DeAndre Jordan pitched in with solid but relatively modest double - double performances . Paul poured in 13 points and dished out 11 assists , while Jordan posted 13 points and hauled in 15 boards . Paul Pierce received a start at small forward but could only muster a paltry two points and one rebound in 19 minutes on the floor . Jamal Crawford and Wesley Johnson paced the Clippers ' bench with a pair of eight - point efforts .
