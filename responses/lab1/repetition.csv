The free - throw shooting was a huge disparity as well , as the Lakers hit 21 - of - 25 while the Bucks went just 11 - for - 20 . Milwaukee was coming off one of their biggest wins in team history , but it does n't matter much anymore after losing to a four - win Lakers team . They still want 1 - 1 in those two games like everyone expected and that win means almost nothing now . This team continues to play poorly on both ends and there does n't seem to be a light at the end of the tunnel . Michael Carter-Williams was the lone bright spot in this game , as he tallied 19 points , five rebounds and five assists off the bench . They did have to play this game without Greg Monroe and that left them with very little post presence . Monroe missed the game due to some knee soreness and his status is up in the air for Milwaukee 's next game against the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday . The Lakers have been struggling mightily all season , but this was a great all - around performance . Seven players scored in double - figures with Kobe Bryant leading the team with 22 points . The bench was espcially good , as youngsters Julius Randle and D'Angelo Russell both played well here . Randle recorded a 14 point - 14 rebound double - double , while Russell amassed 19 points , seven assists and four rebounds . It 's rare to see this Lakers team hit on all cylinders like this , but it 's a good sight for Los Angeles fans . They 'll look to build off this rare win , when they take in the Houston Rockets on Thursday in their next scheduled game .",sys0,B,"{""user_agent"":""Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/109.0.0.0 Safari/537.36 Edg/109.0.1518.70"",""clicks"":[{""click_x"":530,""click_y"":1469,""nodeName"":""INPUT"",""id_tag"":""next-intro"",""time"":""Sun May 21 2023 10:20:38 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)""},{""click_x"":226,""click_y"":445,""nodeName"":""DIV"",""id_tag"":""no_id"",""time"":""Sun May 21 2023 10:20:39 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)""},{""click_x"":244,""click_y"":469,""nodeName"":""STRONG"",""id_tag"":""no_id"",""time"":""Sun May 21 2023 10:20:40 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)""},{""click_x"":244,""click_y"":469,""nodeName"":""INPUT"",""id_tag"":""myCheckbox"",""time"":""Sun May 21 2023 10:20:40 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)""},{""click_x"":416,""click_y"":534,""nodeName"":""INPUT"",""id_tag"":""next-intro"",""time"":""Sun May 21 2023 10:20:40 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)""},{""click_x"":114,""click_y"":693,""nodeName"":""INPUT"",""id_tag"":""best_redun"",""time"":""Sun May 21 2023 10:21:16 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)""},{""click_x"":114,""click_y"":762,""nodeName"":""INPUT"",""id_tag"":""next-summary1"",""time"":""Sun May 21 2023 10:21:18 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)""},{""click_x"":23,""click_y"":391,""nodeName"":""CROWD-BUTTON"",""id_tag"":""no_id"",""time"":""Sun May 21 2023 10:21:21 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)""}],""start_time"":""Sun May 21 2023 06:36:56 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)""}",False,False,,A,,

Sunday , even Griffin succumbed to the malaise that currently seems to surround Los Angeles , mustering a season - low nine points , along with six rebounds , four assists and a pair of steals . He also turned the ball over a season - high six times in a forgettable performance versus a Raptors defense that had been vulernable to opposing power forwards coming into the game . Toronto enjoyed impressive contributions from every starter , with DeMarre Carroll and DeMar DeRozan leading the way with a pair of 21 - point efforts . Kyle Lowry pitched in with his second double - double of the season ( 13 points , 10 assists ) , while veteran power forward Luis Scola continued a resurgent age - 35 season with 20 points and eight rebounds . It was the second outing with 20 or more points for Scola in his last three contests . Meanwhile , Bismack Biyombo posted six points and a season - best 14 rebounds in a season - high 31 minutes of playing time . Toronto improved to 9 - 6 and remains in first place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division . They head home for a date with the Cavaliers on Wednesday . The Clippers received rather pedestrian offensive efforts from other starters besides Griffin as well . Redick managed a team - high 17 points in his second game back from a back injury , while Paul and DeAndre Jordan pitched in with solid but relatively modest double - double performances . Paul poured in 13 points and dished out 11 assists , while Jordan posted 13 points and hauled in 15 boards . Paul Pierce received a start at small forward but could only muster a paltry two points and one rebound in 19 minutes on the floor . Jamal Crawford and Wesley Johnson paced the Clippers ' bench with a pair of eight - point efforts . Los Angeles dropped to 6 - 7 and reside in third place in the Western Conference 's Pacific Division .

He then subsequently lost the handle on a drive to the basket with 2 seconds left in overtime as he attempted to tie the game at 105 , essentially sealing Orlando 's fate . Lowry did manage to lead the Raptors with 24 points despite the subpar shooting performance , as he was able to drain 12 of 14 attempts from the charity stripe . He also hauled in eight rebounds , dished out seven assists , and tallied a block and a steal . DeRozan contributed a modest 13 points , but was outstanding on the boards , posting a season - high 11 rebounds for his first double - double of the season .

Meanwhile , the Magic duo of Victor Oladipo and Evan Fournier caught fire , particularly in the second half , to drain 18 of their 31 field - goal attempts . However , despite a game - high 27 points , Oladipo could n't find the net when he needed it most , missing a 27 - foot three - point jumper with two seconds left that almost certainly would 've given the Magic a 98 - 96 victory . He then subsequently lost the handle on a drive to the basket with 2 seconds left in overtime as he attempted to tie the game at 105 , essentially sealing Orlando 's fate . Lowry did manage to lead the Raptors with 24 points despite the subpar shooting performance , as he was able to drain 12 of 14 attempts from the charity stripe . He also hauled in eight rebounds , dished out seven assists , and tallied a block and a steal . DeRozan contributed a modest 13 points , but was outstanding on the boards , posting a season - high 11 rebounds for his first double - double of the season . Jonas Valanciunas matched DeRozan 's scoring total and added nine boards , two assists , a steal and three blocks , two of which were key stuffs of Nikola Vucevic in the fourth quarter and overtime , respectively . Luis Scola put together a solid contribution of 11 points , two rebounds and three steals , while three Raptors reserves were highly efficient . Corey Joseph led the way with 19 points , four assists , three rebounds and a pair of steals over a robust 36 minutes , while Bismack Biyombo and Patrick Patterson pitched in with a pair of 11 - point outings . The latter 's scoring partly consisted of a trio of three - pointers , which tied him with Scola for the team lead in that category on the afternoon .

Oladipo 's 27 points were supplemented by six rebounds , six assists and a pair of steals . Fournier was right on his heels with 21 points , three assists , three rebounds and a steal . Nikola Vucevic posted a 17 - point , 11 - rebound double - double , which he complemented with four assists and three blocks . Tobias Harris nearly matched him point - for - point and board - for - board , tallying 16 on the scoreboard and hauling in 11 off the glass . He also dished out three assists and recorded a steal . Jason Smith was outstanding off the bench in the first half for Orlando with 16 points , but came up empty scoring - wise in the second half and the extra period .

The Nets hit the Cavaliers with a big wake - up call , sending them packing with a loss . Brooklyn came out tough from the start and led 59 - 49 at halftime , however Cleveland responded with a big third quarter and took a three - point lead into the fourth . The Nets were relentless as they battled back in the fourth , beginning with 10 points in the first four minutes , including eight from Rondae Hollis-Jefferson . Cleveland still managed to get up by two with six minutes left , but that is when the Nets went on a 14 - to - 3 run to end the game and upset the top team in the East . This result snaps a three - game losing streak for the Nets and a two game winning streak by the Cavs . The clubs have one more meeting before the end of the season , with the season - series at 2 - 1 for Cleveland . Five players scored in double digits for Brooklyn , while all six remaining players to hit the floor also contributed significantly on the scorecard , making this a true team - effort . Brook Lopez led the way with 22 points , seven rebounds and five assists , in 31 minutes , while Shane Larkin also came up large , with 16 points , seven assists and three rebounds , in 31 minutes . The Nets assisted on 28 of their 41 field goals while their defense held the Cavs to only 44 percent from the field , 26 percent from long range and forced Cleveland into 15 turnovers . LeBron James had a very solid outing , with 30 points ( 13 - 16 FG , 1 - 3 3Pt , 3 - 4 FT ) , six rebounds , five assists and one steal , in 35 minutes of action , but it was not enough to get his team over the hump in this one .
