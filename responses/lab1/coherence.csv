Throughout a difficult start to the season that has included multi - game injuries to starters Chris Paul and J. J. Redick , the Clippers have been able to lean on Blake Griffin as a dependable source of outstanding production . Sunday , even Griffin succumbed to the malaise that currently seems to surround Los Angeles , mustering a season - low nine points , along with six rebounds , four assists and a pair of steals . He also turned the ball over a season - high six times in a forgettable performance versus a Raptors defense that had been vulernable to opposing power forwards coming into the game . Toronto enjoyed impressive contributions from every starter , with DeMarre Carroll and DeMar DeRozan leading the way with a pair of 21 - point efforts . Kyle Lowry pitched in with his second double - double of the season ( 13 points , 10 assists ) , while veteran power forward Luis Scola continued a resurgent age - 35 season with 20 points and eight rebounds . It was the second outing with 20 or more points for Scola in his last three contests . Meanwhile , Bismack Biyombo posted six points and a season - best 14 rebounds in a season - high 31 minutes of playing time . Toronto improved to 9 - 6 and remains in first place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division . They head home for a date with the Cavaliers on Wednesday . The Clippers received rather pedestrian offensive efforts from other starters besides Griffin as well . Redick managed a team - high 17 points in his second game back from a back injury , while Paul and DeAndre Jordan pitched in with solid but relatively modest double - double performances . Paul poured in 13 points and dished out 11 assists , while Jordan posted 13 points and hauled in 15 boards . Paul Pierce received a start at small forward but could only muster a paltry two points and one rebound in 19 minutes on the floor .

The rebounding was the big difference , as the Lakers grabbed 52 to Milwaukee 's 38 . The free - throw shooting was a huge disparity as well , as the Lakers hit 21 - of - 25 while the Bucks went just 11 - for - 20 . Milwaukee was coming off one of their biggest wins in team history , but it does n't matter much anymore after losing to a four - win Lakers team . They still want 1 - 1 in those two games like everyone expected and that win means almost nothing now . This team continues to play poorly on both ends and there does n't seem to be a light at the end of the tunnel . Michael Carter-Williams was the lone bright spot in this game , as he tallied 19 points , five rebounds and five assists off the bench . They did have to play this game without Greg Monroe and that left them with very little post presence . Monroe missed the game due to some knee soreness and his status is up in the air for Milwaukee 's next game against the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday . The Lakers have been struggling mightily all season , but this was a great all - around performance . Seven players scored in double - figures with Kobe Bryant leading the team with 22 points . The bench was espcially good , as youngsters Julius Randle and D'Angelo Russell both played well here . Randle recorded a 14 point - 14 rebound double - double , while Russell amassed 19 points , seven assists and four rebounds . It 's rare to see this Lakers team hit on all cylinders like this , but it 's a good sight for Los Angeles fans . They 'll look to build off this rare win , when they take in the Houston Rockets on Thursday in their next scheduled game .",sys0,B,"{""user_agent"":""Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/113.0.0.0 Safari/537.36"",""clicks"":[{""click_x"":474,""click_y"":1828,""nodeName"":""INPUT"",""id_tag"":""next-intro"",""time"":""Wed May 24 2023 07:27:52 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)""},{""click_x"":145,""click_y"":495,""nodeName"":""STRONG"",""id_tag"":""no_id"",""time"":""Wed May 24 2023 07:27:54 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)""},{""click_x"":145,""click_y"":495,""nodeName"":""INPUT"",""id_tag"":""myCheckbox"",""time"":""Wed May 24 2023 07:27:54 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)""},{""click_x"":432,""click_y"":561,""nodeName"":""INPUT"",""id_tag"":""next-intro"",""time"":""Wed May 24 2023 07:27:54 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)""},{""click_x"":150,""click_y"":889,""nodeName"":""INPUT"",""id_tag"":""best_coh"",""time"":""Wed May 24 2023 07:28:42 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)""},{""click_x"":67,""click_y"":967,""nodeName"":""INPUT"",""id_tag"":""next-summary1"",""time"":""Wed May 24 2023 07:28:49 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)""},{""click_x"":143,""click_y"":885,""nodeName"":""INPUT"",""id_tag"":""best_coh"",""time"":""Wed May 24 2023 07:28:53 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)""},{""click_x"":96,""click_y"":971,""nodeName"":""INPUT"",""id_tag"":""next-summary1"",""time"":""Wed May 24 2023 07:28:58 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)""},{""click_x"":740,""click_y"":117,""nodeName"":""INPUT"",""id_tag"":""englishY"",""time"":""Wed May 24 2023 07:29:00 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)""},{""click_x"":744,""click_y"":114,""nodeName"":""INPUT"",""id_tag"":""englishY"",""time"":""Wed May 24 2023 07:29:01 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)""},{""click_x"":24,""click_y"":385,""nodeName"":""CROWD-BUTTON"",""id_tag"":""no_id"",""time"":""Wed May 24 2023 07:29:02 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)""}],""start_time"":""Wed May 24 2023 07:27:19 GMT-0400 (Eastern Daylight Time)""}",False,True,,A,,

When it was all said and done , the pair of guards who struggled throughout five periods bested the two with the hot hand . In an overtime thriller in London , DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry played as if they 'd left their shots back across the Atlantic , going a combined 9 - for - 39 from the field . Meanwhile , the Magic duo of Victor Oladipo and Evan Fournier caught fire , particularly in the second half , to drain 18 of their 31 field - goal attempts . However , despite a game - high 27 points , Oladipo could n't find the net when he needed it most , missing a 27 - foot three - point jumper with two seconds left that almost certainly would 've given the Magic a 98 - 96 victory . He then subsequently lost the handle on a drive to the basket with 2 seconds left in overtime as he attempted to tie the game at 105 , essentially sealing Orlando 's fate . Lowry did manage to lead the Raptors with 24 points despite the subpar shooting performance , as he was able to drain 12 of 14 attempts from the charity stripe . He also hauled in eight rebounds , dished out seven assists , and tallied a block and a steal . DeRozan contributed a modest 13 points , but was outstanding on the boards , posting a season - high 11 rebounds for his first double - double of the season . Jonas Valanciunas matched DeRozan 's scoring total and added nine boards , two assists , a steal and three blocks , two of which were key stuffs of Nikola Vucevic in the fourth quarter and overtime , respectively .

Corey Joseph led the way with 19 points , four assists , three rebounds and a pair of steals over a robust 36 minutes , while Bismack Biyombo and Patrick Patterson pitched in with a pair of 11 - point outings . The latter 's scoring partly consisted of a trio of three - pointers , which tied him with Scola for the team lead in that category on the afternoon . The Raptors improved to 25 - 15 and remain atop the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division . They head back home to take on the Brooklyn Nets on Monday . Oladipo 's 27 points were supplemented by six rebounds , six assists and a pair of steals . Fournier was right on his heels with 21 points , three assists , three rebounds and a steal . Nikola Vucevic posted a 17 - point , 11 - rebound double - double , which he complemented with four assists and three blocks . Tobias Harris nearly matched him point - for - point and board - for - board , tallying 16 on the scoreboard and hauling in 11 off the glass . He also dished out three assists and recorded a steal . Jason Smith was outstanding off the bench in the first half for Orlando with 16 points , but came up empty scoring - wise in the second half and the extra period .
