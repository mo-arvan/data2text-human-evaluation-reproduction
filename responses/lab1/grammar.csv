In an overtime thriller in London , DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry played as if they 'd left their shots back across the Atlantic , going a combined 9 - for - 39 from the field .

However , despite a game - high 27 points , Oladipo could n't find the net when he needed it most , missing a 27 - foot three - point jumper with two seconds left that almost certainly would 've given the Magic a 98 - 96 victory . He then subsequently lost the handle on a drive to the basket with 2 seconds left in overtime as he attempted to tie the game at 105 , essentially sealing Orlando 's fate .

When it was all said and done , the pair of guards who struggled throughout five periods bested the two with the hot hand . In an overtime thriller in London , DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry played as if they 'd left their shots back across the Atlantic , going a combined 9 - for - 39 from the field . Meanwhile , the Magic duo of Victor Oladipo and Evan Fournier caught fire , particularly in the second half , to drain 18 of their 31 field - goal attempts . However , despite a game - high 27 points , Oladipo could n't find the net when he needed it most , missing a 27 - foot three - point jumper with two seconds left that almost certainly would 've given the Magic a 98 - 96 victory . He then subsequently lost the handle on a drive to the basket with 2 seconds left in overtime as he attempted to tie the game at 105 , essentially sealing Orlando 's fate . Lowry did manage to lead the Raptors with 24 points despite the subpar shooting performance , as he was able to drain 12 of 14 attempts from the charity stripe . He also hauled in eight rebounds , dished out seven assists , and tallied a block and a steal . DeRozan contributed a modest 13 points , but was outstanding on the boards , posting a season - high 11 rebounds for his first double - double of the season . Jonas Valanciunas matched DeRozan 's scoring total and added nine boards , two assists , a steal and three blocks , two of which were key stuffs of Nikola Vucevic in the fourth quarter and overtime , respectively . Luis Scola put together a solid contribution of 11 points , two rebounds and three steals , while three Raptors reserves were highly efficient . Corey Joseph led the way with 19 points , four assists , three rebounds and a pair of steals over a robust 36 minutes , while Bismack Biyombo and Patrick Patterson pitched in with a pair of 11 - point outings . The latter 's scoring partly consisted of a trio of three - pointers , which tied him with Scola for the team lead in that category on the afternoon . The Raptors improved to 25 - 15 and remain atop the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division . They head back home to take on the Brooklyn Nets on Monday . Oladipo 's 27 points were supplemented by six rebounds , six assists and a pair of steals . Fournier was right on his heels with 21 points , three assists , three rebounds and a steal . Nikola Vucevic posted a 17 - point , 11 - rebound double - double , which he complemented with four assists and three blocks . Tobias Harris nearly matched him point - for - point and board - for - board , tallying 16 on the scoreboard and hauling in 11 off the glass . He also dished out three assists and recorded a steal . Jason Smith was outstanding off the bench in the first half for Orlando with 16 points , but came up empty scoring - wise in the second half and the extra period . He did add five rebounds , four assists and a block . The Magic fell to 20 - 19 and remain in third place in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division . They take the long trip back home to face off against the division - leading Atlanta Hawks on Monday .",sys0,"The Toronto Raptors ( 25 - 15 ) defeated the Orlando Magic ( 20 - 19 ) 106 - 103 .

The victory comes after the Hawks dropped three games in a row by a total of 52 points . As for the Celtics ( 38 - 22 ) , they 've now officially hit a slump in what has been a successful season , losing three of their last four games . It was a poor shooting night from the whole team , as they combined to hit just 39 percent of their shots from the field and 29 percent of their three - pointers . Isaiah Thomas did lead the way for the Celtics with 19 points , although it came on a brutal 4 - of - 21 shooting from the field . Other than Thomas , Marcus Smart ( 16 ) and Jaylen Brown ( 15 ) were the only other players to reach double - digit scoring Monday .
