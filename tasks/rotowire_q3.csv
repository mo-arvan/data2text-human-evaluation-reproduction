Milwaukee was coming off one of their biggest wins in team history , but it does n't matter much anymore after losing to a four - win Lakers team . They still want 1 - 1 in those two games like everyone expected and that win means almost nothing now . This team continues to play poorly on both ends and there does n't seem to be a light at the end of the tunnel . Michael Carter-Williams was the lone bright spot in this game , as he tallied 19 points , five rebounds and five assists off the bench . They did have to play this game without Greg Monroe and that left them with very little post presence . Monroe missed the game due to some knee soreness and his status is up in the air for Milwaukee 's next game against the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday . The Lakers have been struggling mightily all season , but this was a great all - around performance . Seven players scored in double - figures with Kobe Bryant leading the team with 22 points . The bench was espcially good , as youngsters Julius Randle and D'Angelo Russell both played well here . Randle recorded a 14 point - 14 rebound double - double , while Russell amassed 19 points , seven assists and four rebounds . It 's rare to see this Lakers team hit on all cylinders like this , but it 's a good sight for Los Angeles fans .
