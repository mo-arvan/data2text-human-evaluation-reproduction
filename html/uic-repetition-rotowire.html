                        <blockquote>
                            <p>The participants will be ask to evaluate sports summaries of (NBA) basketball games. To
                                do so, they need to read two short texts which have been produced by different automatic
                                systems. These systems typically take a large table as input which contains statistics
                                of a basketball game and produce a document which summarizes the table in natural
                                language (e.g., talks about what happened in the game, who scored, who won and so on).
                                We are interested in evaluation the system outputs based on three different categories:
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>Avoid repetition:</strong> Which summary is better at avoiding unnecessary
                                repetition? Unnecessary repetition might take the form of whole sentences that are
                                repeated, or repeated facts, or the repeated use of a phrase </p>
                            <p><strong>Grammaticality</strong> : Are the sentences grammatical and well-formed? The
                                summary sentences should be grammatically correct. You should not rate the document as
                                whole but rather whether the sentences could be written by a native speaker or by
                                someone who is a learner and makes mistakes. Choose the more grammatical summary. </p>
                            <p><strong>Coherence</strong> : How coherent is the summary? How natural is the ordering of
